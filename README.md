# TCNJ ACM Knowledge Base

Welcome to the TCNJ ACM Knowledge Base, where you can find resources on programming, tech news, and materials covered during ACM meetings!

This semester, meetings will be held every **Wednesday from 2:30 to 3:30** in **Forcina 408 or the CS Student Lounge** on the fourth floor of Forcina (unless otherwise stated below).

## This Week's Meeting

The CS department ice cream social (hosted by ACM, WiCS, and UPE) will be this **Wednesday, September 9 from 1:30 PM - 3:00 PM** at the **Science Complex fountain area**.

Since this intersects with our 2:30 PM meeting time, we won't be holding a formal meeting this week. See you all at the Science Complex!
